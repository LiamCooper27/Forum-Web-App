# Forum-Web-App
project from my academic studies

This project was made using Asp.Net core mvc 2.1. The purpose of this web application is to function similar to a forum website where users can write a post and also comment on the post or others posts. This was done in the style of an education blackboard system, the lecturers (type of user) could post and comment and the students (type of user) could comment if they were taught by that particular lecturer. This functionality was implemented using role based authorization which allowed users to do certain things on the website and access certain parts depending on their authorization.
