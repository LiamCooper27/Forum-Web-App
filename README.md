# Forum-Web-App
project from my academic studies

This project was made using Asp.Net core mvc 2.1 on Visual Studio. The prupose of this web application is to work similar to a forum site where users can write a post and then users can comment on posts, but this was done in the style of an education blackboard system. So, the lecturers could post and comment and the students could comment if they were taught by that particular lecturer. This functionality was implemented using role based authorization which allowed users to do certain things on the website and access certain parts depending on their authorization.

Load this project into Visual Studio to run.
